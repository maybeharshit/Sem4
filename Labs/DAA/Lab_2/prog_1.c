Question:Write a program to find GCD using consecutive integer checking method and
analyze its time efficiency.

int mini(int m,int n){
	if(m>=n){
}
/*
After analysis we see that the time complexity of this
program is O(min(m,n)) since the program runs till t 
reaches 0 and the value of t is set to the value of min(m,n)
